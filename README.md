# Sleek

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/sleek`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sleek'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sleek

## Usage

In your `application.css`, include the file:

```css
/*
 *= require sleek
 */
```

If you prefer [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html), add this to your
`application.scss` file:

```scss
@import "sleek";
```

Then restart your webserver if it was previously running.
